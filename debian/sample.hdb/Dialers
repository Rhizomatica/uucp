#  Noisy dialing for a Hayes modem:
# hayes	=,-,	"" \dATE1\r\c OK\r-ATE1\r\c-OK\r ATM1\r\c OK \EATDT\T\r\c CONNECT

#  Quiet dialing for a Hayes modem:
hayes	=,-,	"" \dATE1\r\c OK\r-ATE1\r\c-OK\r ATM0\r\c OK \EATDT\T\r\c CONNECT

#  Setup for a direct connection.
direct

#  Hayes Modem Commands Used in These Examples:
#  ATE1 -- Forces command echo to ON.  (I share my modem with a Mac, which
#	insists on turning off the command echo on the modem, which confuses
#	uucp.)
#  ATM0 -- Turns off the modem speaker.
#  ATDT -- Dial using tone.

#  Note that there are two versions of the initialization for a hayes modem.
#  The one in which the speaker is enabled is commented out.  You may find
#    it helpful to comment out the silent version instead while you debug
#    connection problems.
