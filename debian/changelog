    to Klaus for the report and patch (closes: #349996).
  * Only pass --host $(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE) to configure when it is different
    from DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE.
  * Instead of only setting CFLAGS to '-Wall -g' if they aren't set, always
    add those two.
  * Remove DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS 'nostrip' handling from debian/rules.  dh_strip
    does it all for us anyway.
  * Remove DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS 'debug' handling from debian/rules.  It's
    obsolete and we already build with -g anyway.
  * Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS 'noopt' and build with -O2 if it is not set,
    and with -O0 if it is.
  * Remove -s from LDFLAGS in contrib/Makefile.uurt, dh_strip does the right
    thing later on.
  * Instead of 'cd contrib; make ...' do 'cd contrib && make ...'.
  * Remove the -Wall from cc arguments for building contrib/in.uucpd.c.
    It's already included in $(CFLAGS).
  * Use debian/rules' CFLAGS in contrib/Makefile.uurt.
  * Change to debhelper compatiblity level 4 (from 3) (only updating
    DH_COMPAT setting in debian/rules required)
  * Update Standards-Version from 3.6.2 to 3.7.2 (no additional changes

  * Lintian override killall-is-dangerous.
  * Add "@dircategory Networking tools" to uucp.texi.
  * One only needs the "master" info file, like 'uucp.info', not every
    part like 'uucp.info-1' thru -8 in debian/uucp.info.  Remove the

  * Obey nostrip option, thanks Joerg  (closes: #257275).
  * Move uucico to uucico.real and have a new uucico wrapper.
    This wrapper, if run as root, sets the list of supplementary
    groups for this process to the supplementary groups of the
    uucp user.
    The uucico program needs to have uucp in its supplementary groups
    because it is setuid/gid uucp:dialout and needs to read /etc/uucp/call,
    which is 640 root:uucp.
    Previously one had to ivoke uucico as user uucp (using sudo or su or a
    similar means), now ivoking it as root should work too.

uucp (1.06.1-6) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

uucp (1.06.1-2)
  Wed Oct 18 07:03:23 EDT 1995
  * Modified HDB Dialers example to force command echo to ON.  Wrote up
    comments for this file.

uucp (1.06.1-1)
  * Upgraded to current version if taylor-uucp.

uucp (1.05-5)
  * Changed ``Recommended:'' and ``Optional:'' lists to end with virtual
    package names.
  * Set owner of /usr/sbin/uucico to uucp and group to dialout in debian.rules.
  * Fix permissions of Debug.n.gz files created by savelog in the
    /etc/cron.daily/uucp script.

uucp (1.05-4)
  * Fixed debian.rules to not generate bogus "\n\n" string in release notes.
  * Changed comment on debian.crontab.
  * Changed contents of sample-hdb/Permissions to reflect less acurately
    my own system.
  * Changed owner of /var/log/uucp to uucp.
  * Created a stub uucpconfig and fixed debian.rules to put it into
    /usr/sbin so that the postinst script will be able to run correctly.
  * Removed the commands to create the old configuration directory
    (/usr/lib/uucp) from debian.rules.
  * Added dependancy on cron.
  * Created a debian.conffiles file and made sure that debian.rules will
    install it.
  * Created a script to be installed as /etc/cron.daily/uucp to rotate the
    log files.
  * Created a crontab file to be installed as /etc/uucp/crontab for the
    system administrator to configure and use as the uucp user's crontab
    file.
  * Move the current set of examples into /usr/doc/examples/uucp/taylor.
    Make a set of HDB examples under /usr/doc/examples/uucp/hdb.
  * Upgrade optimization to -O3 in an attempt to make this thing
    less huge.
  * Changed ALLOW_FILENAME_ARGUMENTS (in policy.h) to 0 so as to disable
    the use of arguments to rmail & rnews.
  * Moved the log files to /var/log/uucp/* (in the policy.h file).
  * Made debian.rules create /etc/uucp and /var/log/uucp.
  * Switch to using ``/etc/uucp'' as the directory for HDB-style
    configuration files.  The Taylor-style configuration files
    already use this directory.  Hopefully, they do not conflict.
  * Build this file into the automatically generated release notes.
    (I should edit out the old changes by hand.)
  * Build ``uucp.info*'' out of ``uucp.texi''.
    Install info files in ``/usr/info''.
    List uucp in the info directory.
